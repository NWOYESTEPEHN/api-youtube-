working with YouTube Python API to collect video statistics from a channel using the requests python library to make an API call and save it as a Pandas DataFrame:
Made API call to YouTube API: I passed a URL to the API that specified what data I wanted. I had to read the documentation carefully to build the URL.
Collected data as JSON: I collected the data as a JSON object and parsed through the data saving it as variables first.
Saved the data as a Pandas DataFrame
Lastly, I just added some error handling logic and cleaned up the code
